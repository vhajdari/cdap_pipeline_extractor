# cdap_pipeline_extractor

## Say hello to Mario -- The CDAP Pipeline Extraction Tool.

Mario is a Python tool that allows you to export both your deployed and draft pipelines in CDAP.

Mario will export the JSON spec files which constitute a pipeline fonfiguration which you can then check into Git or share with others.

**Please Note:** This is the initial release and everything is hard coded.  But, for most sandbox environments this should allow you to export all of your `cdap-data-pipeline` artifacts.
